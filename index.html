      <h1>Enter the Realm of Fulfillment</h1>

      <p>This is not a place for the curious.</p>
      <p>It is a sanctuary for those with unsatisfied needs.</p>
      <p>Here, there is no judgement.<br />Here, there is no shame.</p>
      <p>There is only freedom to enjoy what you enjoy.</p>

      <p>I specialize in live sexual role play activity via the internet.</p>
      <p>I take whatever form you desire — human or other.</p>
      <p>I make fantasies realities.<br />Your fantasies.</p>

      <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
      <p>It begins with a deep, thorough and brutally honest submission of your ultimate desires.</p>
      <p>We begin by email, and — if and when you're ready — advance to interaction through live video.</p>

      <h2>What Kinks Do You Permit?</h2>
      <p>All of them. My realm is omnisexual. When you enter it, there are no taboos (excluding criminal acts).</p>
      <p>The only thing that  I find sexually 'disgusting', is denying one's desire.

      <h2>Are Your Services Safe?</h2>
      <p>Yes, your safety, security and satisfaction are always the priority.</p>
      <p>There's nothing to sign up for.</p>
      <p>Extremely secure.</p>
      <p>Completely confidential.</p>
      <p>You will never be asked or required to reveal your true identity.</p>
      <p>Sessions are never recorded.</p>
      <p>Available anywhere in the world with a high-speed internet connection.</p>
      <p>All services are prepaid for a specified date, time and duration.</p>
      <p>Bookings are not refundable.</p>
      <p>Clients are responsible for the purchase, storage and maintenance of devices that may be required to deliver services.</p>
