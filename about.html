      <h1>ðŸ©¸ The Origin of Obedience</h1>
      <p>
        Before there was desire, there was command.<br />
        Before there was pleasure, there was discipline.<br /><br />
        The Crimson Obediancer was not born, but summoned.<br />
        Forged in the whispers of longing and silence of servitude,
        the Obediancer exists only to receive obedience and to sculpt surrender.
